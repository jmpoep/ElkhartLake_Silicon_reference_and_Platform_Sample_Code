  Retrieves a Unicode string that is the user readable name of the controller
  that is being managed by an EFI Driver.

  @param  This             A pointer to the EFI_COMPONENT_NAME_PROTOCOL instance.
  @param  ControllerHandle The handle of a controller that the driver specified by
                           This is managing.  This handle specifies the controller
                           whose name is to be returned.

                           of.  This is an optional parameter that may be NULL.  It
                           will be NULL for device drivers.  It will also be NULL
                           for a bus drivers that wish to retrieve the name of the

                           driver writer.
  @param  ControllerName   A pointer to the Unicode string to return.  This Unicode
                           string is the name of the controller specified by
